# University projects
Describing university projects made in 1st and 2nd semesters.
### 1st semester. C language
#### Sorting strings
[Link](https://github.com/ImmortalTurtle/SpbU-solutions/tree/master/C/3rd-sorts)
 - Implemented a few algorithms for sorting strings. 
 - [Compared](https://github.com/ImmortalTurtle/SpbU-solutions/blob/master/C/3rd-sorts/README.md) amount of time it took for each of them to sort certain amount of strings.
 - [Made a version with ```mmap```](https://github.com/ImmortalTurtle/SpbU-solutions/tree/master/C/3rd-sorts/mmap-version) to find out how much more effective was that.
#### Calculator with long arithmetics
[Link](https://github.com/ImmortalTurtle/SpbU-solutions/tree/master/C/4th-calculator)
Console stack-calculator
 - Few basic operations are implemented, such as: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.
 - Big numbers are based on linked lists.
 
### 2nd semester. Kotlin language
#### Trees: Binary Search Tree, Red-Black Tree and B-Tree
[Link](https://github.com/ImmortalTurtle/SpbU-solutions/tree/master/Kotlin/Forest/src)
 - Designed architecture: common interface for all trees
 - Made [comparing analysis](https://github.com/ImmortalTurtle/SpbU-solutions/blob/master/Kotlin/Forest/src/README.md) of performance.
 - JUnit tests 
 
#### Image viewer
[Link](https://github.com/ImmortalTurtle/UniViewer)

Console application able to open BMP file, parse it byte by byte and display the image in JPanel window.
 - MVC architecture: able to easily edit existing modules and add new ones.
 - JUnit tests: comparing pixel by pixel images parsed by this app and existing libraries.

### 3rd semester. Parallel programming on C# language
[Link](https://github.com/ImmortalTurtle/C-Sharp-Multithreading)
#### There are:
 - QuickSort
 - Prime numbers search
 - Recursive Folder MD5 Hash
 - RedBlackTree with parallel searches in the tree
 - Recursive web-pages parsing with Async
 - Atomic Snapshots of shared memory
